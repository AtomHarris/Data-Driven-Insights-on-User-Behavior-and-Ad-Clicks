    "### Business Overview\n",
    "In the digital age, advertising is a critical component of customer engagement and conversion. However, not all ads perform equally well, and understanding what drives user engagement is key to optimizing ad campaigns. By analyzing user demographics, behavior, and ad characteristics, businesses can tailor their strategies to maximize click-through rates (CTR) and improve return on investment (ROI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Online advertising is a colossal business worth more than [$50 billion](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336666758_Machine_Learning_Based_Ad-click_prediction_system), with advertisers increasingly focusing on targeted ad strategies. As the industry grows, it becomes essential to continuously measure the effectiveness of ads and refine strategies accordingly. One of the key metrics for measuring ad performance is the ad click, which indicates how often users interact with online advertisements. A higher number of ad clicks typically signifies a stronger interest in the advertised product, service, or content, making it a valuable indicator of user engagement and potential conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stay ahead of the competition and optimize ad spending, businesses like Hubspot are leveraging advanced analytics to gain deeper insights into what drives ad engagement. Techniques like A/B testing allow businesses to experiment with different ad variations (e.g., copy, images, targeting) to determine which ones produce the best results. By testing multiple versions of ads with different audience segments, businesses can identify the most effective strategies and apply them at scale, thus improving engagement rates and maximizing ad spend efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, machine learning models can be implemented to predict user behavior based on historical ad interactions and demographic data, enabling businesses to target the right audience with the most relevant ads. This combination of A/B testing and machine learning can significantly enhance ad performance, providing data-driven strategies to refine advertising efforts over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Affiliate Marketing Company, Hubspot seeks to further invest significant resources in online advertising to drive user engagement, awareness, and conversions. However, the challenge often lies in determining which elements of an advertisement – such as content, targeting, timing, and format – are most effective in driving user interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Objectives\n",
    "Our main objective is to determine factors influencing user interaction with online ads and identify actionable insights to optimize ad performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Objectives\n",
    "1. Correlation between higher ad clicks and demographic/behavioral factors\n",
    "2. Investigate the variations in ad content that affect engagement\n",
    "3. validation of these insights through AB testing to recommend data_driven strategies\n"
